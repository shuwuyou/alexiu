**Instructions:**
1. Extract player_info from player_analysis.player_info
2. Put ALL report content inside the "report" object - do NOT put fields at the top level
3. Create executive_summary: Use player_analysis.executive_summary if available, otherwise create 2-3 sentences combining key insights from player_analysis and news
4. Enhance player_development: Take player_analysis.player_development (which is a string) and weave in relevant news context naturally
5. Enhance breakout_analysis: Take player_analysis.breakout_analysis (which is a string) and weave in relevant news context naturally
6. Enhance valuation_insights: Take player_analysis.valuation_insights (which is a string) and weave in relevant news context naturally
7. Copy transfer_fee_analysis: Use player_analysis.transfer_fee_analysis (which is a string) - copy it directly as it analyzes transfer fee drivers using SHAP and MLR data
8. Extract key_statistics: Use player_analysis.key_statistics if available. If not, extract from player_data:
   - current_market_value: Format as string (e.g., "€3M" or "$3 million")
   - peak_market_value: Format as string (e.g., "€16M")
   - career_goals: integer from career totals
   - career_assists: integer from career totals
   - recent_form: Brief description based on recent_form_last_10_games
9. Copy strengths and weaknesses arrays exactly from player_analysis
10. Create recommendation: Use player_analysis.recommendation if available, otherwise create 1-2 paragraphs with recommendations enhanced by news context
11. Write news_context: 2-3 sentences summarizing how news articles relate to the player's situation
12. Include only title and summary for each news article (remove date, source, relevance)
13. Set generated_at to current timestamp in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)

The goal is to create a unified, professional report where news context enhances the analysis naturally. All content must be inside the "report" object.
